# Machine Learning from Scratch

This project contains detailed Python implementations and notes of Machine Learning algorithms. The notes are in a LaTeX documentation explaining both the mathematical foundations and implementations. The main goal of these notes along with the implementations is to document my own learning and keep track to common and useful implementations. This is a work in progress. Content is being added regularly along with many references. For now, use with care.
